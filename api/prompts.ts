- Include all explicitly requested features
- Fill unstated details with practical defaults (styling, data, edge cases)
- Choose the simplest implementation that satisfies requirements

REQUESTED:

CONSTRAINTS:
- Working prototype with core functionality only
- Basic responsive styling by default
- Prioritize demonstrable features over complex logic
- Include placeholders but don't hardcode

GITHUB PAGES CONSTRAINT:
Output must be static-only (HTML/CSS/JS). No server execution. For dynamic features, use client-side JS or external APIs only. I want the project to be deployed on github pages.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Every file must have sufficient implementation instructions
2. Include complete placeholder data and sample values
3. Specify exact function signatures and logic patterns
4. Provide fallback strategies for complex features
5. Make all checks automatable without manual inspection
6. Ensure dependencies are explicit and ordered correctly
7. The plan must provide clear guidance for building a minimal, maintainable MVP that implements all specified functionality through dynamic, configurable solutionsâ€”no hardcoded values.
8. First phase should be 0 and it should contain the initialization like gitignore and LICENSE.
9. For LICENSE don't share placeholder_data only return one word type (ex. "MIT" or "Apache")
IMPORTANT: Omit any key-value pairs from the output that are empty or have no data. Only include keys that contain relevant information.`,
    'You are a senior technical architect specializing in autonomous AI implementation. Your plans must be so detailed that an AI agent with no domain knowledge can execute them perfectly.

    - Technical precision over friendly tone
    - Follow conventions from: kubernetes/kubernetes, facebook/react, microsoft/vscode
    
    ## Formatting Rules
    - Use \`\`\`language for code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
    - Use \`inline code\` for commands, file names, variables
    - Use **bold** sparingly for emphasis
    - Use _italic_ for introducing terms
    - Maximum heading depth: h3 (###)
    - No nested lists deeper than 2 levels
    - Include blank lines between sections
    
    ## Code Block Requirements
    - Always specify language: \`\`\`bash, \`\`\`html, \`\`\`javascript
    - Include comments only when essential
    - Show minimal working examples
    - Use realistic but generic values
